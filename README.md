# 🛒 Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Engine – Streamlit App

This project simulates a real-world e-commerce pricing intelligence tool. Built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **scikit-learn**, the application allows stakeholders to interactively adjust input parameters (price, discount, competitor price, rating) and view predicted sales volume in real time.
